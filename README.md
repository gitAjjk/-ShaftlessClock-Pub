# ShaftlessClock V1.0
Clockwork with no axis / shafts  
Started on [hackaday](https://hackaday.io/project/196036/details/), but further maintained here.

## Version 1: Hollow 
This is a set of large inside gears with small centre gears to next stage.   
Each wheel is an hollow/inner gear; I used old vinyl LongPlayrecords (cheap and abundant available material) and this sets the max size I use.  
The small gears are rigid and concentric mounted on another uncut LP, with a litle distance and flanges.

# Drive
## The outer-ringdrive couldn't be a motor because it has a shaft ;).  
To thrive the wheel each second, I expirimented with (ax-less):  
- A plane pendulum of about 30 cm (swing time: 1 second).
- ["Conical pendulum"](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conical_pendulum)<img src="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/5/53/Conical_pendulum.svg/375px-Conical_pendulum.svg.png" alt="Conical pendulum" width="100">  
- Electromagnetically driven mechanism (todo).
- Wobble (investigating)  

## Easy cheat:  
- Cheap dc motor from China
- microcontroller driven motor

Clockwork with no axis / shafts
## Version 1: Hollow 
This is a set of large inside gears with small centre gears to next stage.   
Each wheel is an hollow/inner gear; I used old vinyl LongPlayrecords (cheap and abundant available material) and this sets the max size I use.  
The small gears are rigid and concentric mounted on another uncut LP, with a litle distance and flanges.
